# geometor-explorer-notebook

This project represents a shift from the previous architecture of the GEOMETOR Explorer.

My recent discovery of some very powerful tools within the Python world has drawn me to 
choose this platform for my further investigation into constructive geometry and the golden ratio.

This project contains the 'geometor' module to facilitate the construction and analysis of geometric figures and a collection of notebooks to study individual constructions

## classical constructive geometry with symbolic algebra

There are a number of tools 

## installation

GEOMETOR Explorer makes heavy use of Jupyter Lab, Sympy and Matplotlib

## Installation

The primary components of this repository Jupyter Lab notebooks. 

To get Jupyter Lab running, I recommend installing Anaconda. https://www.anaconda.com/

It will give you 95% of what you need - particularly Sympy, Matplotlib, and Numpy.

Install the Matplotlib package in Jupyter Lab, This will enable the widget component for plots. 


## todo list

- publish geometor module as a package
- merge points, elements and graphics like segments, polygons, and wedges
  into a single list. This will allow for walking the history
